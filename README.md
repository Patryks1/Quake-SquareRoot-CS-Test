# Quake SquareRoot C# Test
 
I was curious to see if Quakes fast square root would be accurate and fast in C# too. However from running many cycles it seems like the native math library square root is much faster in C#. I suspect the unmanaged dll library done a lot worse due to the overhead of hosting the C++ library. 


This project was made is few minutes so code is messy.
